**Brief description：** 

- Not receiving verification code：

a：Check if the account was entered correctly.

b：Check if the phone number used is in blacklist. For email, please check for blocking or spam.

c：When creating an account, double check if the account has been taken. Verification code won’t be sent to existing account.

d：When resetting password, check if the account has been registered. Unregistered account will not receive any verification code.

If you have gone through the questions above and still can not get a verification code, please submit a feedback in eWeLink app. We will try to help as soon as possible. Thanks
